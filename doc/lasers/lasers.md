11:46 PM] dstar: a) blue zone, frame 1 and 2
[11:47 PM] dstar: this is the warn notification, we basically loop between these 2 frames for 1.5-2 seconds
[11:47 PM] dstar: so the player can have a notification of something will happen, the beam doesnt appear from nowhere, we must be fair
[11:48 PM] dstar: b) purple zone (frame 3- 10)
[11:49 PM] dstar: charging state, i designed these frames in order to have a smooth appearance of the laser
[11:49 PM] dstar: c) red zone (frame 11-17)
[11:50 PM] dstar: laser hitbox is enabled, this is where this hazard does its damage, the frames are loopable
[11:50 PM] dstar: d) green zone (rest of frames)
[11:52 PM] dstar: laser shuts down, hitbox is disabled, again i designed this for a smooth transition between the states
